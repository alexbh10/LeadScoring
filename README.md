# LeadScoring

We use Lead Scoring technique, which is used to qualify the leads so that we can priorize them after.
Then, the machine learning model can be called in order to make their leads qualification.
Besides, we make a segmentation by means of a no supervised model in order to understand what type of leads we have to recomend to our comercials.
